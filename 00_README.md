The easyCODA R package accompanies the book and is available on CRAN, version 0.28.
The package is still under development and the latest version can always be found on R-Forge, installing as follows from R:

  install.packages("easyCODA", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

(the latest version is 0.31, with a few important bug fixes, especially to the function STEP, so please reinstall this version until the latest version is on CRAN).

The package does include the data sets, but the data files are given here as well in Excel or character format.

DATA SETS:

Vegetables.txt: Vegetables data set, data object 'veg' in easyCODA

TimeBudget.txt: Time budget data set, data object 'time' in easyCODA

R SCRIPTS:
